# Explore-Weather-Trends
Udacity Data Analyst Degree - Project I

## Overview
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

## What Software Do I need?
To complete this project, i'll require the following softwares:
- SQL
- Excel

## Extracting Data
To start I wrote an SQL query to retrieve all the temperature data from:
- Local Database (Baku)
- Global Database

Upon retrieving the data, it was extracted on a CSV file for further evaluation.

## Data Selection & Manipulation
Once the data has been extracted on CSV, it was possible to further evaluate the data on Excel. To provide a more accurate and useful dataset for comparison a range of the common years only was chosen.

Moreover, due to fluctuations in yearly averages, the data was evaluated considering moving averages (7-years) to provide smoother results during data visualization. 

## Data Visualization
Once the dataset was ready, it was time to plug n play. The first chart shows a comparison between the global and local temperature set across the years.<br>

The second plot shows the global average temperature range across all the years to view a trend for the entire dataset.<br>



## Observations
- The Baku city’s temperature has been consistently higher than the global average over time.
- Over time, it seems that the city’s temperatures have changed similarly to the global average.
- Over time, both types of temperature (global and local) show an upward trend, that is the world is getting hotter.
- The change of the climate between the globe and Baku city is slightly small, and both of them are raising.
